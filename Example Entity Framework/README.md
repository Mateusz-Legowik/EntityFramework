Simple example with Entity Framework Core in Console Application 

Description of preparing the environment:
1. Install these packages:
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQLite
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
2. DatabaseContext.cs - this code defines two C# classes using Entity Framework Core to interact with an SQLite database. The DatabaseContext class inherits from DbContext and contains the connection settings for the database as well as the definition of a data set represented by the Book class. The Book class represents a book data model with properties such as Id, Title, Price, Author, and Description. The lengths of the Title and Author fields are restricted to 150 characters using the StringLength attribute.
3. Program.cs - creates an instance of the DatabaseContext class, representing a connection to an SQLite database based on the settings defined in the DatabaseContext.cs file. It then initializes a new Book object representing a book and adds it to the data set using database.Books.Add(b). After adding the changes, database.SaveChanges() is called to save the changes to the database. Finally, the program displays information about all the books in the database, such as title, author, and price, using a foreach loop. The functionality of the program is based on the data model definition and database settings from the DatabaseContext class in the DatabaseContext.cs file.
4. For the error message "no such table: Books", provide the exact path to the database file.
